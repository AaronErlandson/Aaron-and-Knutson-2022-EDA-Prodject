## Revised Abstract 

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a form of a group of diseases called
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). CWD is a growing
concern for the future of not only deer populations, but for all cervid
species, including mule deer, elk, and moose. We want to explore
publicly available data from state wildlife agencies with information
regarding CWD in wild North American cervids. We plan to look at the
geographic distribution of incidence and prevalence of CWD.
