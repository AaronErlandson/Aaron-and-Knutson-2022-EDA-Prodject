## Title
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a form of a group of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). CWD is a growing concern for the future of not only deer populations, but for all cervid species, including mule deer, elk, and moose. We want to explore publicly available data from state wildlife agencies with information regarding CWD in wild North American cervids. We plan to look at the geographic distribution of incidence and prevalence of CWD, and genetic variations of CWD using publicly available sequence data from GenBank.
