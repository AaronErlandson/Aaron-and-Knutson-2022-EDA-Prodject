## Title
Chronic wasting disease is a form of a group of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE).  For our EDA project, we wanted to work with data regarding Chronic wasting disease (CWD) in wild cervids. CWD is a growing concern for the future of not only deer populations, but for all cervids, including mule deer, elk, and moose.  We want to look at Minnesota DNR CWD testing data, we also want to possibly incorporate genetic data from GenBank.  The prion protein gene (Prnp) has been associated with CWD in white-tailed deer, as well as other cervids.  The Prnp is well conserved among humans as well as cervids.  The Prnp gene encodes the protein that is responsible for TSEs.  Various polymorphisms in the Prnp gene lead to different prion protein forms that have been known to regulate an individual's susceptibility to infection as well as the development and growth of the disease.  The polymorphism G20D has been associated with reduced chances of testing positive for CWD for example.  We hope to possibly look into relationships between incidents and prevalence of CWD geographically, and corresponding incidents of polymorphisms in the Prnp gene.  We want to start with population data from Minnesota and then possibly look at other states as well.
